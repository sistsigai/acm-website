                    The first round of the event was a non-technical fun activity, "Trash to Treasure." All the students were divided into teams and provided with a bunch of trash and chart paper. They were tasked with creating something innovative from the materials they were given. The students showed immense enthusiasm and worked wonders with their creations. The results were evaluated by our faculty coordinators, <strong>Dr. R. Sathyabama Krishna and Dr. Anu Barathi</strong>. Two winners were selected from the teams.
